AJ's DOODLE WORLD 

OVERVIEW OF THE GAME

AJ's Doodle World is a 2D sidescrolling platformer game. The goal of the game is to get AJ out of his Doodle World; each level contains a key and a door to unlock. Find the key in each level and make it to the door to get to the next level. The game is won once AJ makes it to the third and final door of the level. Monsters of all sorts will be found along the way; AJ must shoot them with fireballs to kill them. Getting hit by a monster will decrease AJ's health - and some of them are quite intelligent, so beware! The final level contains a Boss that AJ must defeat before he is granted access to the final door. Coins can also be collected throughout the levels; pick them up to score extra points!

CHALLENGES FACED:
So.. Many.. Having the character interact with the environment (bounce of walls and such), creating enemies that could be shot/that could also harm the player, keeping track of score, etc... Having to figure out how to use classes was a big component for this project... I had numerous classes for the different enemies and ammunition and such. Once I got the hang of it, however, it wasn't too difficult. A huge struggle for me was having the player switch between levels; I had so many problems in terms of removing/adding levels to the "stage"... Furthermore, all the coins and enemies always had to be reset every time the level changed, and this proved to be far more difficult than I thought it would be. 

MOST PROUD OF:
There were several things I was very proud of with this project... First of all, some of my enemies had artificial intelligence, which I was very excited about achieving... The gargoyles are able to track the player's movement and follow him, which was something I worked hard to accomplish. Furthermore, having the program save a player's highscore to the computer's local drive was something I was extremely proud of. I also thought that incorporating sound effects into the game was a nice touch.
